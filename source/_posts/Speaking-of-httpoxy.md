1.  Service who get HTTP_PROXY from environment `PATH` could be infected (wget/curl will be fine).
2.  Service data could be stolen while connecting outbound destination by attackers'Â given `HTTP_PROXY`.
3.  Under CGI/FPM mode.
4.  Fix for nginx: add these to `fastcgi.conf`:
{% codeblock lang:nginx %}
fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";
{% endcodeblock %}
5.  Apache has official update.
